    "detail" : [ "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which most commonly affects the lungs. It is spread from person to person by inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs of people with the active disease in their lungs.", "TB can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. It is a serious condition, but can be cured with a combination of specific antibiotics, treated for at least six months.", "The typical symptoms of TB disease of the lungs include:" ],

    "detail" : [ "People with latent TB are infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis but do not have TB disease. They feel well and do not have any symptoms. The only sign of TB infection is a positive reaction to a TB blood test or a skin test. People with latent TB are not infectious and cannot spread the bacteria to others. However, they are sometimes prescribed prophylactic treatment to prevent them from developing TB disease in the future.", "In some people, the bacteria overcome the defences of the immune system and begin to multiply, leading to the progression from latent TB infection to TB disease. Some of them develop the TB disease soon after the initial infection, and others develop TB disease years later, possibly because their immune system becomes weaker. In many cases, we do not know why some people remain well and others develop disease." ],

We can measure immune memory for TB using the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) or a TB blood test.", "The Mantoux TST involves injecting a mixture of proteins obtained from dead TB organisms (tuberculin) into the skin in the lower part of the arm (A). A positive response to the TST, characterised by redness (B) and swelling (C), must be read and measured within 48 to 72 hours.", "Skin test interpretation mainly depends on two factors: measurement of the swelling area and the person’s risk of being infected with TB and of progression to disease if infected.", "The Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) is a newer blood test that also detects immune memory in blood cells within a tube rather than under the skin.", "Both of these tests are used to find out if someone has been infected with TB in the past, but they do not distinguish active and latent infection." ],
